EXPERIMENT 002: LAGGED ACWR-INJURY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Date: 20260102_082954

OBJECTIVE
---------
Experiment 001 showed counterintuitive results: HIGH ACWR was associated
with LOWER injury rates. This experiment investigates whether this is due
to reverse causality (injury -> reduced training -> low ACWR).

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. PRE-INJURY WEEK ACWR VS BASELINE:
   - Pre-injury week ACWR: 1.056
   - Control (non-injury) ACWR: 1.039
   - Difference: +0.017
   - p-value: 7.20e-01
   - Cohen's d: 0.030
   - Significant: NO
   => ACWR IS HIGHER in the week before injury!

2. LAGGED RELATIVE RISK (7-day lag):
   - Relative Risk: 1.296
   - 95% CI: [1.011, 1.662]
   - p-value: 4.67e-02
   => HIGH ACWR (7 days prior) INCREASES injury risk!

3. OPTIMAL PREDICTION LAG:
   - Best lag: 5 days
   - AUC: 0.5080
   => HIGHER ACWR predicts MORE injuries

CONCLUSIONS
-----------

The data SUPPORTS the ACWR-injury hypothesis when using proper temporal analysis:
- ACWR IS higher in the week before injuries
- High ACWR (7 days prior) IS associated with increased injury risk

The initial counterintuitive results were due to reverse causality:
injured athletes have LOW ACWR because they reduce training after injury.
